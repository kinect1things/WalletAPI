- Development, Quality Assurance, User Acceptance Testing and Production environments will have seperate branches from the master branch

- Jenkins will be used to deploy each branch to track success/failure of build testing and deployment

- Developer role based access will be leveraged to provide seperation of duty and responsibility

- Lead developers will perform the following responsibilities:
